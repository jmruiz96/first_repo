# first_repo

## Description

- This project was intended to refactor this webpage's HTML and CSS code.
- This webpage's code was non-descriptive and there was repetitive code.
- I was able to add semantic elements and simplfy code but not delete the old code but comment out repetitive code.
- This project taught me to use semantic elements over non-semantic and to "DRY" code.
